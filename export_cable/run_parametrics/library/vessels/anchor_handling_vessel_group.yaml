# For the purpose of code, this is 'one' vessel.  However, this is double the cost of the anchor handling vessel, and double the storage specs so that 2 are essentially 'going out at the same time' wihtout initializing 2 vessels.
transport_specs:
  max_waveheight: 3       # m
  max_windspeed: 20       # m/s
  transit_speed: 10       # km/h
vessel_specs:
  day_rate: 200000        # USD/day. This is 2x a typical vessel cost to represent cost of group of 2
  overall_length: 300     # m. Again, 2x typical vessel spec
  mobilization_days: 7    # days
  mobilization_mult: 1   # Mobilization multiplier applied to 'day_rate'
